#Mission
This project will be an application that will simulate a blackjack table at a casino. 
You will be able to chose how many people are at the table with you (max of 7), and also how many decks the dealer uses
#Goals
The goal of this app is to help people learn how to count cards in blackjack. 
It will provide a brief explination, a tutorial, and tools to help you learn.
This application will be developed using unity
#Progress
The current progress of this has been the creation of the board as it took longer than expected to design / get this project working
